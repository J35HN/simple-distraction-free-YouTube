# simple-distraction-free-YouTube
_Super simple Extension for a distraction-free experience on YouTube_

## Installation
Download the ZIP file. Extract the extension folder (``simple-distraction-free-YouTube/extension``) to any desired location.

Go to your Manage Extensions page. On a new tab, search chrome://extensions (chrome browser) or edge://extensions (edge browser).

Enable Developer Mode (in case it is not enabled).

Click the Unload unpacked button, and select the directory of the downloaded extension folder.

## Usage
Just click the Extension to turn ‘ON’ or ‘OFF’.

By default, the Extension is set to ‘ON’. The Extension will inject a CSS file on a YouTube link (YouTube Home or a YouTube video). If YouTube appears normal, click the Extension to switch from ‘ON’ to ‘OFF’ to lastly ‘ON’, and pray that it works 🙏. 

If an element you desire to see doesn’t appear, turn off the Extension.

## Why did I create this?
I got tired from having so many elements on my screen SCREAMING for my attention. I wanted an experience where I could only see a YouTube video and just that; no comments, no shorts, no related videos, no categories, etc.

Plus, this helps me with my attention span and procrastination. I no longer binge-watch YouTube videos because it’s no longer easy to click the next video. And, I’m only focused on the video, I no longer scroll down to read comments or select a new video to watch right after.
